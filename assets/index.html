      <p>Do you do a stretch or strength routine prescribed by your personal trainer, physio or one of your own? Having
        a
        hard time with timing, or tempted to skip exercises? This is the solution.</p>
      <p><strong>Stretch Timer</strong> transforms your routine from a chore to a pleasure, giving you discipline and
        convenince. You
        won't
        want to go back to a stop watch once you use it.</p>
      <p>It tells you both on-screen and through voice when to start and stop and rest. It times every stretch, every
        rest,
        and includes preparation time to move from one position to another.</p>
      <p>It says "All Finished" in a sweet way when you are done. Boy, that is satsifying after doing those training
        exercises!</p>
    </div>
    <h1>How to use it</h1>
    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The stretch timer runs from a web page, and works on all your devices.</li>
      <li>The timer lets you create an exercise program, which is simply a sequence of exercises.</li>
      <li>Each exercise has a name, provided by you, and some settings:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>duration</strong> is the number of seconds to hold the stretch.</li>
        <li>The <strong>rest duration</strong> is the number of seconds to rest before the next stretch.</li>
        <li>The <strong>repetitions</strong> is the number of times to do the stretch followed by the rest period.</li>
        <li>The <strong>prepare time</strong> is the number of seconds you need to get into a position where you can
          start the stretch.
          E.g. if you need to tie up a band to a door handle, then you might want 10 seconds to do this.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>When you start the exercise program, it will run through each exercise, and then say "prepare" with a count
        down for the amount of prep time. It will then say "go" with a count down for the amount of stretch time.
        It will then say "rest" with the count down for that too. It will then repeat for the number of reps you
        specified, and move to the next exercise.
      </li>
      <li>You set up the exercise program through the web page, and the program is stored on your browser. There is
        currently no way to save this anywhere else, but this may be added later.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to use</h2>
    <p>To open the app, click the button below:</p> 
    
    <div class='starttimer2'>
      <a class='button' href='timer.html'>Start Stretch Timer</a></div>
    <p>When you first open the app, there is no exercise program and you are invited to add your first stretch:</p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="home.png" alt="screenshot" />
    <p>Clicking "ADD YOUR FIRST STRETCH" will show this form with the fields to fill out for the timings I mentioned in
      the Concepts section above:</p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="addfirststretch.png" alt="screenshot" />
    <p>Fill this in and click SAVE to add this first stretch. You will then see your exercsie program, with one
      exercise:</p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="exerciseprogram1.png" alt="screenshot" />
    <p>You can add more by clicking ADD ANOTHER STRETCH. You can also click the ... button to perform actions on the
      exercise, such as editing, deleting and moving:</p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="dotdotdot.png" alt="screenshot" />
    <p>When you are ready to start, click START and the program will begin. You will hear the voice say "Prepare":</p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="prepare.png" alt="screenshot" />
    <p>At any time click HOME to go back to the home screen. This pauses the routine so you can resume again. Also you
      can use the navigation controls to skip back and ahead or pause the exercise</p>
    <p>The up and down arrow buttons skip to the previous or next exercise. The back and forward buttons skip to the
      previous or next rep. And the pause button lets you pause and resume the program.</p>
    <p>If you want to start the program in a particular place, from the home screen click ... next to an exercise and
      then click START HERE</p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="dotdotdot.png" alt="screenshot" />
    <p>And that is all there is too it. Good luck and happy stretching!</p>
